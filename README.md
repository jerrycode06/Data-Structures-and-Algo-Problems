# Data-Structures-and-Algo-Problems

I am practicing these problems in my Quarantine days so that's why pushed these programs to GitHub.

### Recursion - 
When the function calls itself is called Recursion. Inside the recursion, there is a base condition which will made recursion terminate.
Problems related to recursion present in this Repository 

### Array - 
An array is collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of same type together. Once a Array 
is created ,its size is decided at compile time that type of array is called the Static Arrays. But If we want to make array in which its size 
decided at run-time so that arrays is called Dynamic Arrays which is created by Pointers. 
``` 
int *p;
p = new int[5];
\\statements
delete []p;
```

We have to delete this Array memory when it is of no use . You can read more about Dynamic Memoy Allocation at -

There are some problems related to arrays present in this repository . 

### Linked Lists - 
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

### Stack - 
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be
LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked 
over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed 
at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First 
Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.

If you have better approach of any of these problems, you are very welcome to contribute here .
